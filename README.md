### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full Stack Web developer with a strong growth mindset and a commitment to learning. I am willing to ask questions and get things done as a team, so let's talk.

I have finished an intensive, hands-on coding program with Bloomtech institute of technology, focused on learning and creating projects, with over 1000 hours of coding. I love working with my peers on creating new applications together and have made it a personal focus to understand different approaches to solving a problem.

Before my time at Bloomtech I worked as a concrete truck dispatcher, managing customer accounts and driver scheduling. Whether it was talking with customers or helping drivers, I always strive to make sure that they end the call with the satisfaction that the problem will get taken care of.

What else is there to know about me? I love painting miniatures, playing games, and spending time with my loved ones. I aim to combine my hobbies with my technical skills to make a truly unique project, utilizing my skills as a developer.

I am looking to find myself in the tech field as a developer shortly, doing project construction and testing in a company I love. If you want to chat feel free to contact me here or email me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project that will act as a kanban board for hobbyists.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use ant design and improving my styling for my react applications.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that is interesting, possibly including React Redux as I wish to improve in that area.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my project ideas, I have some interesting web page and application ideas that may interest you.
