### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project that will act as a kanban board for hobbyists.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use ant design and improving my styling for my react applications.

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that is interesting, possibly including React Redux as I wish to improve in that area.

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my project ideas, I have some interesting web page and application ideas that may interest you.

- ğŸ“« How to reach me:

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a hobbyist at heart and I love to paint miniatures, I'm into the attention to detail of things.
